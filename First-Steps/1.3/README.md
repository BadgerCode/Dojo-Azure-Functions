# 1.3 Other ways to trigger a function
* A **function trigger** is what causes the function to start
* Functions also support **input and output** through bindings

So far, the tutorials have used functions which are triggered by **HTTP requests**.
* Input: HTTP request
* Output: HTTP response



## Available triggers
Whenever you create a new function, you are given the choice as to which function trigger you wish to use.

Some other triggers are:
* Messages from a queue (e.g. Service bus, Azure Storage Queue)
* Files that are modified or created (Blob trigger)
* Timer trigger

## Create a function with a different trigger
The next set of tutorials will involve creating functions triggered in different ways.<br>
