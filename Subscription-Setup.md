# Set up an Azure subscription

## What is a subscription?
Anytime you create a resource on Azure, you assign it to a subscription.<br>
This is used to manage billing for the resource.

## How much do Azure resources cost?
Most resources either have a free version or come with a free allowance before you are charged.<br>
Typically, when playing around with functions and storage accounts, it will only cost around Â£0.01.

To check the price of a resource, use the [Azure pricing calculator](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-gb/pricing/calculator/).

## How do I sign in?
You will need a **Microsoft account** in order to use Azure.
* This can be a personal or work account.
* Microsoft accounts are [free to create](https://account.microsoft.com/account).
